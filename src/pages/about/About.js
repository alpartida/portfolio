                        <p className='paragraph'>Hi ðŸ‘‹, all! Welcome to my portfolio page. I am an apparel production manager turned web developer. I graduated a 6 month coding bootcamp and have also completed SheCodes for additional learning on web development. I have fully made my transition into tech and I am currently working as Web Developer at The Salt Lake Tribune. The Tribune being a non-profit news organization, make me me feel like my work is impactful and adds meaning to what I do everyday. Not to mention, this new career has made an impact to my life and the at of my daughter's. She sees her mom making it everyday in a field where there isn't a lot of female representation. Hopefully I inspire her to do the same one day!</p>
